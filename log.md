### Day 1: February 2, 2024
**Today's Progress**: 
1. Learned about anonymous functions, some depth to strings as well as some basic data structures.
2. More C++ Review in preparation for starting using SFML library.


### Day 2: February 3, 2024
**Today's Progress**: 
1. Learned about Elixir's more data structures - streams, which look useful. -  and processes - which are VERY important to why I want to learn this language.


### Day 3: February 4, 2024
**Today's Progress**: 
1. Learned about how to properly interact with files in Elixir; and some finer points about how Elixir deals with strings efficiently.

### Day 4: February 5, 2024
**Today's Progress**: 
1. Learned about how to build modules, import them and access them from your programs.
2. I don't quite understand some of the extended module attributes examples; they use and apply without *really* describing them. 
3. Got SFML working and started playing with accepting events, drawing windows for vidja game.


### Day 5: February 6, 2024
